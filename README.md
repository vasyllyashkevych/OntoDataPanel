# OntoDataPanel
Working with ontology's concepts v.2
Here, code doesn't show all functionality, only one part for concept managing. The next update of the code is planned on the 1 of June 2017.

From my experience, it can be so useful panel for working with relations among concepts of ontology (meta ontology).
This tools was tested on the over 1 million concepts in dictionary.

The main advantage over other tools that the expert can manage the relations between concepts within taxonomy, can change taxonomy 
of classes. In attached presentation you can find the general tutorial for working with OntoDataPanel v.1. The tutorial for OntoDataPanel v.2
will be shown on the 1 of June 2017.

Have a pleasure from working!
