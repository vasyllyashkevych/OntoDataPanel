# OntoDataPanel
Working with ontology's concepts v.2.

This code is not final and doesn't show all the functionality, only one part for concept managing.

From my experience, it can be so useful panel for working with relations among concepts of ontology (meta ontology).
This tools was tested on the over 1 million concepts in dictionary.

The main advantage over other tools that the expert can manage the relations between concepts within taxonomy, can change taxonomy 
of classes. In attached presentation you can find the general tutorial for working with OntoDataPanel v.1. 

Have a pleasure from working!
